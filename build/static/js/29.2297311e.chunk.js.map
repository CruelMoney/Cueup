Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Cueup may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.

For notices made via a Communication, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.\n  </p></li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong>\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <strong>retain the right to seek</strong> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <strong>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</strong>\n</p></li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>If you reside in the United States, you and Cueup agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Collective Content (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>“) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Cueup are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Cueup otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/arb_med\"><em>www.adr.org/arb_med</em></a>or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Arbitration Process</em>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased\"><em>form Demand for Arbitration</em></a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Arbitration Location and Procedure</em>. Unless you and Cueup otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed <span>$</span>10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Cueup submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds <span>$</span>10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Cueup will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Fees</em>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed <span>$</span>75,000, Cueup will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Cueup changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Cueup’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Cueup in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n</p></li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>General</strong>\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>The failure of Cueup to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Cueup. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\n  </p></li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Third party beneficiary</strong>\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.\n  </p></li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Additional Clauses for Users Contracting with Cueup Ireland</strong>\n</p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>The following paragraphs will apply if you are contracting with Cueup Ireland.\n  </p><p></p>\n\n<p></p><p>The second paragraph of Section 24.D, <strong>Term and Termination, Suspension and Other Measures,</strong> shall be removed and replaced with the following: “<em>If you or we terminate this Agreement, we do not have an obligation to return to you any of your Member Content, including but not limited to any reviews or Feedback.
