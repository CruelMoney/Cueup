A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>    </p><p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at all without cookies.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>    </p><ol style={{listStyleType: \"upper-alpha\"}}>\n<br/>      <li><strong>Cueup cookies and Third Party cookies</strong><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>Cueup may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, Third Parties may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely “<strong>persistent cookies</strong>” and “<strong>session cookies</strong>”.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>      </p></li>\n<br/>      <li><strong>Other technologies</strong><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>      </p></li>\n<br/>      <li><strong>Uses for Cueup cookies</strong><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>Cueup uses cookies and similar tracking technologies for a number of purposes, such as the following:</p>\n\n<p>        </p><ul>\n<br/>          <li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages, devices and browser sessions.</li>\n<br/>          <li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>\n<br/>          <li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize it.</li>\n<br/>          <li>to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>\n<br/>          <li>for fraud detection and prevention.</li>\n<br/>        </ul></li>\n<br/>      <li><strong>Uses for Third-Party cookies</strong><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to Cueup. For example, Third Parties we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise Cueup DJs or services to you on the Platform and Third-party websites, or to help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments. Third Parties websites that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/\"><em>Network Advertising Initiative</em></a> and/or the <a href=\"https://www.cueup.com/terms/%5Bhttp:/www.aboutads.info/choices/\"><em>Digital Advertising Alliance</em></a>. You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/\"><em>Ad Preference Manager</em></a>. Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on or about the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the Cueup mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>      </p></li>\n<br/>      <li><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong><p></p>\n\n<p>        </p><p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform.
