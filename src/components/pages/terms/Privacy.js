        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          LASIK, or “laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis,” is the most common refractive surgery procedure. Refractive surgeries, including LASIK, reshape the cornea to correct distorted vision often eliminating the need for glasses or contacts.

          Higher-order aberrations are visual problems not captured in a traditional eye exam. In a young healthy eye, the level of higher-order aberrations are typically low and insignificant. Concern has long plagued the tendency of refractive surgeries to induce higher-order aberration not correctible by traditional contacts or glasses. The advancement of lasik technique and technologies has helped eliminate the risk of clinically significant visual impairment after the surgery.

          The following are some of the more frequently reported complications of LASIK:

          1. Dry eyes

          2. Overcorrection or undercorrection
